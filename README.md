# 2D-Portfolio

[Check](https://diogorua.github.io/2D-Portfolio/) my 2D-Portfolio where i describe a little bit more about myself. 

This project was made with the help of FreeCodeCamp. Check the full tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs&t=5309s) if you want. 

# How to run

You have to install ```Node.js``` and ```npm``` on your machine to run the project

```npm install``` (this command installs npm which is the default package manager for ```Node.js```)

```npm run dev```

# How to build the project

```npm run build```

Once the build is complete, youâ€™ll see a dist folder. It holds the optimized version of your app, ready to be deployed.
